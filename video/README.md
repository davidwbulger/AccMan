I'm including this mainly for my own convenience and future reference.
I created [a YouTube video to describe this project](https://youtu.be/dHK-RqhQYiM), and I took the opportunity to learn to use the animation software `manim`.
So most of the graphics appearing in the video can be generated by code in this folder.

I also edited the video using `ffmpeg`, and a `Python` script here builds the `ffmpeg` command.
